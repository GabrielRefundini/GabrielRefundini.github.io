Yesss I used LLM to help me formatting this post. Don't blame me, it was taking too long to format this markdown full of references and links. Well this introduction is written by a human...

The exam was easier than I expected. It had 77 questions and I had plenty of time, 12 minutes left when I finished it. My main concern when doing the mocks exam was about endurance and agility to answer 90 questions in 90 minutes (I knew the real exam didn't have it but it was a good practice) and I was struggling with that.

I took too long to do the exam, I was supossed to have finish it 4 months ago but I changed my focus on other topics and I wanted to pass on the first try.

In my opinion the content covered in Sec+ is excellent, worth studying even beyond just passing. So I recommend to take about 3 months studying the materials listed here. But only to pass the exam 2 months are more than enough.

Don't let the fear of not passing and losing your money to stop you. I rescheduled the exam a lot of times because I was scared I wouldn't pass and the exam turned out to be much easier than my mind made me believe! Next certification, I'll schedule the exam way sooner! (but I do like to study in depth to learn besides to pass the exam.)

I chose to take my exam in Portuguese because I could have 2 languages on questions and translate anytime between them (Portuguese and the original question in English).

All the acronyms were in English, which helps, it would be a mess if they weren't.
